You play as a cat that was entombed with their master, the great Pharaoh. Unfortunately, you died with your master. Luckily, cats have nine lives. You must escape the pyramid!

Each time you die (because the pyramid has numerous security measures in place), you lose one of the nine lives (you start the game having already lost one life).
